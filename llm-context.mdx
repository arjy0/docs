The killer feature: **Copy the full bug context and paste it to your coding agent.**

## What's included

When you copy bug context from Sonarly, you get everything your AI needs to fix the issue:

```
Fix the AuthenticationError in auth.service.ts line 145.

Context:
- Error: User blocked after login
- Location: validateUser() function
- Network: GET /api/user/status returned 403
- Console: [error] "Invalid session token"
- User action: Clicked "Login" button
- Previous page: /signup
- Stack trace: [full stack with source maps]
- Related code: [relevant code snippets]
```

## How to use

1. Open the bug in Sonarly
2. Click **"Copy context"** button
3. Paste in Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT/Windsurf
4. Let your AI fix the bug with full context

## Why this matters

Traditional debugging requires you to:
1. Read the error message
2. Find the file and line number
3. Check console logs
4. Inspect network requests
5. Understand user actions
6. Manually explain all this to your AI

With Sonarly, all of this is **automatically packaged** and ready to paste.

## Example workflow

  <Step title="Copy context">
    Click the alert link, then click "Copy context"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste in Cursor">
    Open Cursor, paste the context in chat
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI fixes it">
    Cursor analyzes the context and proposes a fix
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Review, commit, and deploy the fix
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported coding agents

Sonarly's context format works with all major AI coding assistants:

- **Cursor**: Paste in chat or composer
- **Claude**: Paste in conversation
- **ChatGPT**: Paste in chat
- **Windsurf**: Paste in chat
- **GitHub Copilot**: Paste in chat
- **Codeium**: Paste in chat

## Context customization

You can customize what's included in the copied context:

- **Stack traces**: Include full or abbreviated
- **Code snippets**: Number of lines before/after error
- **Network requests**: Include request/response bodies
- **Console logs**: Include all or only errors

Configure in your project settings.

## Privacy note

Sensitive data (passwords, tokens, API keys) is automatically redacted from the copied context. You can configure additional redaction rules in your project settings.
