The killer feature: **Copy the full bug context and paste it to your coding agent.**

## What's included

When you copy bug context from Sonarly, you get everything your AI needs to fix the issue:

```
Fix the AuthenticationError in auth.service.ts line 145.

Context:
- Error: User blocked after login
- Location: validateUser() function
- Network: GET /api/user/status returned 403
- Console: [error] "Invalid session token"
- User action: Clicked "Login" button
- Previous page: /signup
- Stack trace: [full stack with source maps]
- Related code: [relevant code snippets]
```

## How to use

1. Open the bug in Sonarly
2. Click **"Copy context"** button
3. Paste in Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT/Windsurf
4. Let your AI fix the bug with full context

## Why this matters

Traditional debugging requires you to:
1. Read the error message
2. Find the file and line number
3. Check console logs
4. Inspect network requests
5. Understand user actions
6. Manually explain all this to your AI

With Sonarly, all of this is **automatically packaged** and ready to paste.
