---

When a bug is detected, you can replay the exact session where it happened.

## What you see

- **DOM replay**: See exactly what the user saw
- **User actions**: Clicks, scrolls, form inputs
- **Console logs**: All console.log, warn, error
- **Network requests**: All fetch/XHR with request/response bodies
- **Backend traces**: Linked server-side logs and errors

## Timeline

Errors are marked on the timeline so you can jump directly to the moment the bug occurred.

## Privacy

You can configure what data is captured in your Sonarly dashboard. By default:
- Sensitive form inputs are masked
- Personal data is redacted
- You control what network requests are recorded
