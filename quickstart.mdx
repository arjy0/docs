Sonarly is an AI-first debugging platform that detects bugs, clusters them intelligently, and generates LLM-ready context to fix them with your coding agent.

## Fastest configuration in the world

Sonarly is designed for the fastest setup possible. Everything you need is already configured and ready to go with our [1-minute onboarding at sonarly.dev](https://sonarly.dev/docs). Just copy our super prompt, paste it into your coding agent, and you're done.

## What is Sonarly?

Sonarly captures user sessions, detects bugs automatically, and gives you everything you need to fix them fast — including context ready to paste into Cursor, Claude, or any AI coding assistant.

### The 4 pillars of Sonarly

| Step | Feature | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 1️⃣ | **One-click configuration** | Copy our super prompt → paste it in Cursor/Claude/Windsurf → your agent configures everything (tracker, sourcemaps, backend) in one shot |
| 2️⃣ | **AI-powered alerts** | We detect issues in frontend AND backend, cluster them intelligently, and alert you only when it matters |
| 3️⃣ | **Issue replay** | Replay the exact session where the bug occurred — see console logs, network requests, and backend traces |
| 4️⃣ | **LLM-ready context** | Copy the full bug context (error, location, network, logs) and paste it to your coding agent to fix it |

## Get started
