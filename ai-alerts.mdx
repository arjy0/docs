Sonarly doesn't just collect errors — it **understands** them.

## How it works

1. **Detection**: Captures errors from frontend (JS exceptions, console.error) and backend (Sentry traces)
2. **Clustering**: Groups similar errors together using AI
3. **Prioritization**: Identifies critical issues based on frequency, user impact, and severity
4. **Alerting**: Sends email alerts with full context:
   - Error message
   - File and line number
   - Function name
   - Occurrence count
   - User sessions affected

## Example alert

```
🚨 New critical issue detected in yourwebsite.com

A user is blocked after the login                    [Critical]

This AuthenticationError occurred 3 times in the last 2 minutes 
in auth.service.ts at line 145 (validateUser function).
```

## Why AI clustering matters

Without clustering, you'd get flooded with alerts for the same issue. Sonarly's AI groups similar errors together so you only get notified once per unique problem.

### Traditional error tracking
- ❌ 100 alerts for the same bug
- ❌ No context about user impact
- ❌ Manual triage required

### Sonarly AI alerts
- ✅ 1 alert per unique issue
- ✅ Automatic severity detection
- ✅ Full context included

## Alert configuration

Configure your alert preferences in the Sonarly dashboard:

- **Severity threshold**: Only alert on critical/high issues
- **Frequency**: Immediate, hourly digest, or daily digest
- **Channels**: Email, Slack (coming soon)
- **Team notifications**: Route alerts to specific team members
