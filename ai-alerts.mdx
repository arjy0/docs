Sonarly doesn't just collect errors — it **understands** them.

## How it works

1. **Detection**: Captures errors from frontend (JS exceptions, console.error) and backend (Sentry traces)
2. **Clustering**: Groups similar errors together using AI
3. **Prioritization**: Identifies critical issues based on frequency, user impact, and severity
4. **Alerting**: Sends email alerts with full context:
   - Error message
   - File and line number
   - Function name
   - Occurrence count
   - User sessions affected

## Example alert

```
🚨 New critical issue detected in yourwebsite.com

A user is blocked after the login                    [Critical]

This AuthenticationError occurred 3 times in the last 2 minutes 
in auth.service.ts at line 145 (validateUser function).
```

## Alert configuration

You can configure alert thresholds and notification preferences in your Sonarly dashboard.
