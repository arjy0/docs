## Supported languages and frameworks

Sonarly works seamlessly with the following stacks:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    Static sites and web applications
  </Card>
  <Card title="NPM" icon="node-js">
    JavaScript and TypeScript projects
  </Card>
  <Card title="Python" icon="python">
    Python applications and scripts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Node.js" icon="node">
