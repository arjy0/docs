## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does the one-click configuration work?">
    Copy the config prompt from your Sonarly dashboard and paste it into your coding agent (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf). Your agent will automatically install the tracker, configure sourcemaps, and set up backend tracing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What frameworks does Sonarly support?">
    Frontend: React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, and vanilla JS. Backend: Express, NestJS, Fastify, Django, FastAPI, Flask. See the [frontend](/frontend) page for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do AI-powered alerts work?">
    Sonarly detects errors from frontend and backend, clusters similar issues using AI, and sends email alerts only for critical issues among Blocking, Annoying and Harmless issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is LLM-ready context?">
    When a bug is detected, you can copy the full context (error, location, network requests, console logs, backend traces) and paste it directly into your coding agent to fix the bug.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my data secure?">
    Yes. Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest. You control what data is captured (sensitive inputs are masked by default). We never share your data with third parties.
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="Tracker not connecting">
    Check that:
    - Your `projectKey` is correct
    - `ingestPoint` is set to `https://sonarly.dev/ingest`
    - Enable debug mode: `__debug__: 5`
    
    If issues persist, contact us at founders@sonarly.dev
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sourcemaps not working">
    Verify that:
    - `.map` files are generated in your build
    - Upload command succeeded (no 404 errors)
    - Sourcemap paths match production URLs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Backend traces not appearing">
    Check that:
    - DSN format is correct: `https://KEY@sonarly.dev/ID`

    - Backend was restarted after configuration
    - CORS allows `x-sonarly-session-id` header
